### API used in this app: 
Maps Javascript API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

### App Summary:
SustainaChoice allows users in the Washington, D.C. area to enter their location and find results on where they can find sustainably-sourced food in their area. Users can search by zip code and filter by type (restaurant, farmers market, grocery store, bar), or they can simply choose to see all results for all locations. Results are shown as a list, and the user can click on any list item to read more information on it. Clicking on a map marker will zoom into that location on the map, and clicking the 'x' button will cause the map to zoom back out.

Users can choose to make a new search directly from the results page, instead of navigating back to the homepage.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
